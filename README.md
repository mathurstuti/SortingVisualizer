Sorting Visualizer: A Web-Based Sorting Algorithm Visualization Tool

Sorting Visualizer is a self-made project designed to enhance user understanding of popular sorting algorithms through interactive visualization. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this web-based tool allows user to select and implement various sorting methods, providing an immersive learning experience.

With Sorting Visualizer, user have the freedom to choose the sorting algorithm of their choice from a selection of well-known algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more. Simply select your desired algorithm and initiate the sorting process with a click of a button.

To further customize user's learning experience, Sorting Visualizer offers adjustable settings. One can modify the speed of the sorting process, allowing them to observe each step at their preferred pace. Additionally, they have the ability to adjust the size of the array, enabling user to experiment with different input sizes and witness the algorithm's performance under varying conditions.

The reset feature in Sorting Visualizer generates a new random array, allowing user to repeatedly practice and explore different scenarios. This helps solidify understanding of sorting algorithms and their behavior with different inputs.
